# Tutorial
## Rclone.conf setup
- Setup Rclone by following these instructions: https://rclone.org/docs/
- After you're done with the setup 'rclone.conf' will be created in C:\Users\USERNAME\.config\rclone
- Open 'rclone.conf' there should be text inside looking like this
```conf
[Drive Name]
type = drive
client_id = 1234567890qwertyuiopasdfghj.apps.googleusercontent.com
client_secret = qwert_yuiopasdfghjlzxcvb
scope = drive
token = {"access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"1//xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","expiry":"2020-02-0123:01:01.12345678+01:00"}
team_drive = 12A_345rSFJDIWD
```
- Copy from `type = ...` to  `... token = ...` or `team_drive = ...` if you used a Team Drive in the Rclone setup
- From the above copied items change each line break to `\n`
- Save this text somewhere
## Deploying
- Click the 'Deploy to Heroku' button below
- In `ARIA2C_SECRET` put any text (make sure to save the text for later)
- In `HEROKU_APP_NAME` put the name of your Heroku app, it will be above on the same page
- In `RCLONE_CONFIG` paste the saved text you made from the 'Rclone.conf setup' part of this tutorial
- In `RCLONE_DESTINATION` set a path you want to store your downloaded files. It should have a `/` before it. So it should look something like this: `/NameOfFolder`

## Setting up the app
- After the app has been deployed open this link: `http://APPNAME.herokuapp.com/` make sure to use `http` NOT `https`
- The page should ask you for your aria2 secret, you made it above, input it
- Then click 'Go to AriaNG panel'
- A popup should come saying your app is connected, if not you did something wrong
